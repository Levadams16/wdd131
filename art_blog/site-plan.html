			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this assignment is to make a blog post where I can post stories that I have
				and artists can post their art to this blog and then share their art with each other.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience is mainly for people who like to make art and want to show off their art.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>JavaScript will be able to make this webpage more dynamic by having the description be 
				counting how many words there are in the box. I can also make it more dynamic so that
				the genre can have different text pop up depending on the genre chosen. For instance,
				if the genre news was chosen, it can show text saying, "Make sure the news is accurate!"</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>Content of the home page will have a heading saying, "Create your story here" and it will have text boxes below it.
				One of which will be the Title. Below that will have a dropdown button with selected categories of posts to choose.
				Below that will have a big description input box that will have a word counter below that. Below that it will have
				a button that says, "Post Story". Below the button will have a line going across the page, then below that will have
				text saying "Saved Stories" which will have links to saved stories below it with the title of the pages being the
				links. Then, below that will have the footer which will have two buttons, one for going back to the top of the page,
				and the other to go to the posting page, which is the page they are on.
			</p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>Content of the child page below the navbar will have the title as the header of the page. Below that to the left, will
				have the genres chosen by the author. Below that in the middle of the screen will have the description with any images
				in the text that the author wants as well. Below that will have the same footer that is on the home page.
			</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The image in the header is the logo and is the same image that will appear in the footer as well.
				The word: below the description box is a word counter that will count how many words there are 
				in the description.
